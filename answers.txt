MMN 11:

Q.1 - it's not the best possible solution. DFS returns the first solution it finds, not necessarily the shortest,
    That's because it doesn't check all successor states from a given starting state.
    As a consequence, in MediumMaze it misses a somewhat shorter path to the goal.

Q.2 -

Q.3 -

Q.4 - It looks like A* with manhattan heuristic got the shortest path in the shortest time (compared to UCS and BFS).
    On the other hand, DFS got a path in the overall shortest time, but the path it found was suboptimal.
